## Exciting feature

We had users in mind when building this project so using the Progressive Web App (PWA) feature available on the browser, users can now install Klaytn Watch on their devices as a standalone application and there will be no need to navigate to the browser everytime to use Klaytn Watch.

### How to install on Mobile

Automatically when you visit Harmatch on your mobile device you should see a pop up at the bottom of your screen asking you to add Harmatch to your Home Screen. If this is not the case you can navigate to the three dots at the top right of your browser, when you click it you will see Install, click on Install to download Klaytn watch as an application on your device.

### How to install on Desktop

If you are on Harmatch's home page, at the far right in your search bar, you will see an icon indicating for you to install it on your desktop, click on the icon and Klaytn Watch will be available on your Desktop for use.
